20050126: Removed the DB library and replaced db functions with my own. Ahhhhhh at last I have
          sharks with fricken laser beams attached to their heads!

20050127: Applied patch for bug report #1110284. Thanks to chadth for the patch.

20050128: Applied patch #1111106 to allow custom mode for the VOL plugin. Thanks to chadth for the patch.

20050128: Applied patch #1111167 to fix some html in the docs. Thanks to chadth for the patch.

20050131: Scanner now saves all parms except the symbols selected. We don't save symbols selected
          because big performance issues will appear if thousands were in the list.

20050131: A double mouse click in the Scanner, Tester, Portfolio panels will open the clicked
          item in the list.

20050131: Added CSV export option to the chart panel. CSV exports chart in CSV format, and the
          dump options dumps the raw chart along with header.

20050203: Quote plugins now remember input files selected in the settings dialog.

20050204: Added a "Fundamental" download method option to the yahoo plugin. Selecting this option will
          download all the yahoo fundamental info for each symbol selected. The fundemental info
	  can then be viewed by selecting the "Edit" option from the chart panel context menu.

20050205: Fixed bug in MySQL plugin that didn't create the symbols if they did not already
          exist. This was caused by trying to remove deleted symbols from the list. This can't
	  work without user updating the symbol list, there is no way to distinguish between
	  a user wanting to create a new symbol and a user deleting the chart.

20050206: Added cancelUpdate function to the MySQL, CSV, NYBOT plugins. Was not implemented.

20050206: Added a splitter to the data panel.

20050207: Applied patch #1117680 - patch docs broken links. Thanks to David Crossley for the patch.
          This fixes some broken doc links.

20050207: Changed the indicator panel behaviour to list all indicators. The user can now turn on/off
          any indicators in the Qtstalker/indicators directory. There is also a context menu available
	  for each indicator in the list.

20050210: Code cleanup. Moved menubar functions into a new class MainMenubar. Moved toolbar2 functions
          into new class ChartToolbar. QtstalkerApp is getting too big, need to spin off more code
	  into new classes.

20050210: Added new option to the Pref's dialog. The 'Main Menubar' checkbox allows user to hide
          the main menubar if left unchecked.

20050213: Changed the behaviour of the side panel list cursor movements. Now you can move the cursor
          anywhere on the list without loading the selected item. To load the chart the user either
	  double clicks the mouse or presses the enter or return key. This is so you can select charts
	  to modify them without having to load them first.

20050213: Fixed bug with stacked indicator not drawing after being turned on/off.

20050213: Fixed bug that segfaults if a turned off indicator is modified.

20050214: Fixed bug #1122245 - issues with CSV and NYBOT plugins.

20050214: F1-F12 keys now run macros assigned to them using the 'Assign Macro' menu option
          in the Macro side panel.

20050215: Scanner now saves and loades all the symbols selected when the user saves the scanner with 'Apply'.

20050215: Added a 'Name' field parm to the CSV plugin.

20050216: Applied patch from vinaynaik to correct BB logic error.

20050218: Can now run multiple scanners in one go. Use the new 'Run Scanner' menu option.

20050218: Put a chart reload timer into the toolbar. Value set will reload the chart every X minutes.

20050218: Added a reload interval timer to the CSV plugin. The timer will only start once the
          user has opened the CSV settings dialog and set the timer. A zero value will turn it
	  off. Non zero value will import the selected input files every X minutes. Once the
	  user saves the settings dialog will the timer take effect. This is to ensure we don't
	  have the timer always running. The timer will stop if the user closes the quotes dialog
	  or if a different quote plugin is selected. If you want to keep the timer going you will
	  have to keep the quotes dialog open and left at the CSV method.

20050218: The position of indicators can now be changed. Use the 'Move Indicator' menu option
          in the indicator panel.

20050218: Plugged a memory leak that was first reported to appear in the scanner. Traced into
          the CUS plugin when unplotted PlotLine's were not being freed.

20050219: Added log/scale to screen options on the tester charts. The tester charts now link
          to the main app toolbar settings.

20050219: Added a splitter to the Tester charts.

20050219: Fixed bug that didn't always save chart pref changes when requested.

20050220: When editing a CUS formula, a double mouse click on the line will bring up the
          edit dialog.

20050220: Fixed bug in LOWPASS that segfaults if input data is empty.

20050220: Fixed focus bug in the chart panel that didn't enable the Edit Chart option in the
          context menu when chart was selected.

20050220: Backported QAction code to Qt3.1 in MainMenubar::

20050220: Changed the default colors of chart objects to be red. Users that use a white background
          couldn't see the objects being created. Red is an unlikely color anyone will use as
	  a background to avoid this problem in the future.

20050220: Optimised scanner by loading the minimum amount of bars for each chart. Removed the
          bars parm from the scanner dialog.

20050220: Changed the group side panel list behaviour to match the chart panel.

20050221: Ugh...removed the chart reload timer from the toolbar...not needed...I forgot
          we already have a reload signal coming from the quotes plugin...

20050221: Added a scaling option for each step in a CUS formula. If the user checks a step
          that is also marked to plot, the checked step will ignore the scaling boundaries
	  of the related plots and will scale relative to itself. This allows the user to
	  put say a BB plot overtop a RSI and keep the scaling readable for both plots. The
	  only downside to this is the scaled plot will not match the Y axis of the other
	  unscaled plots.

20050224: It seems that my sharks swam amok and pointed their fricken lasers at each other and
          self destructed. In other words, the home grown DB functions were a failure. Had to bite
	  the bullet and port back to Berkeley DB 4. Oh well...I'm going to have several drinks now....
	  This means that CVS users will have to install Berkeley DB 4.* and convert all their data
	  to using the new format.

20050224: Removed the ENV and PC indicators. Can easily be reproduced by a CUS formula.

20050224: Fixed bug that segfaults if an indicator is deleted with no chart loaded.

20050224: Fixed bug in tester that checks unused trading rules and issues 'COMP missing' message.

20050226: Changed the plugin loading routines in Config to ignore the file extension. Let QLibrary
          figure out what kind of dll it is. This helps portability.

20050226: Fixed scope issues with some compilers with indicator plugins loading and saving
          settings.

20050226: Added the ability to create indicator groups to the indicator panel. A default group
          called Indicators will contain all of your original indicators. This group
	  cannot be removed. This is for the noobs.The user can create any number of new groups
	  and add indicators to them. To switch between groups, just select the group from the
	  combobox located above the list. All indicators in the list are global. Local indicators
	  that apply only to the current chart, have yet to be implemented.

20050226: Fixed first visible bar appearing always neutral in the Bars chart plugin

20050226: Fixed CSV plugin rule editor to update the save button when the comboboxes are changed.

20050227: Applied patch #1152912 - update for install.html. Thanks to David Crossley for the patch.

20050227: Fixed DbPlugin::deleteBar function header.

20050228: Applied patch to correct SD indicator plugin logic. Thanks to Vinay Naik for the patch.

20050228: Added "CONFIG += qt" parm to the configure script for OSX.

20050228: Specific indicators can now be applied to individual charts. When you want to apply
          a specific indicator, you create a new one using the indicator panel context menus.
	  To apply the indicator you need to select the "Local" option from Indicator Group parm.
	  Once the indicator is applied and saved the indicator will appear only when that
	  particular chart is viewed. If you change charts, the local indicator will disappear.

20050301: Changed the 'delete all chart objects' dialog to allow user to select which object type
          to delete.

20050302: Moved MA functions from IndicatorPlugin:: into MA plugin.

20050303: Plot:: code clean up. Split this class into 3 helper classes DatePlot, ScalePlot and
          IndicatorPlot. Moved them from /src into /lib.

20050303: Code clean up, moved all pixmaps from /src into new directory /pics.

20050303: Changed quote plugins to verify the source of updates match original source that
          created the chart. This is in response to data corruption by the CSV plugin attempting
	  to update charts with matching symbol names and different data formats.

20050303: Added a 'Data Directory' option to the CSV plugin. If this option is used, then
          all updates will be forwarded to this directory. This is to help partition data
	  better for custom uses. For example, if the user were to enter 'mystocks' as
	  as a directory, and the type of security was a Stock, then the directory
	  ~/Qtstalker/data/Stocks/mystocks would be created and all symbols stored in that
	  location. The plugin would limit it's updates to that directory.

20050304: Code clean up, moved Navigator class from /src into /lib.

20050304: Big change for the Yahoo plugin. Due to naming conflicts with ticker symbols from
          foreign exchanges and system performance concerns, we had to make a big change to the
	  directory structure of ~/Qtstalker/data/Stocks/*. Instead of all stocks being dumped
	  into one directory, the Yahoo plugin will now store symbols in sub-directories
	  according to their exchange origins. It will follow the Yahoo naming conventions.
	  For example:

	  ~/Qtstalker/data/Stocks/Yahoo/US - USA stocks
	  ~/Qtstalker/data/Stocks/Yahoo/AX - AUD stocks
	  ~/Qtstalker/data/Stocks/Yahoo/L - UK stocks
	  etc..etc..

	  This allows any plugin to work from a common directory structure and allow
	  the ability to create a unique work space so as not to interfere with any other plugin
	  data space.

20050304: Yahoo plugin can now download the entire history of symbols if requested. The 200
          day limit has been fixed.

20050305: Fixed time delimiter. If the ":" delimiter was not included the time was rejected.
          Now delimiter is not needed.

20050305: Added 'Symbol Filter' option to CSV plugin. This allows the user to filter out
          all unmatching symbols from an input file. If left blank then all symbols will
	  be imported. For example: if user enters 'IBM,RHAT' then all symbols except
	  IBM and RHAT will be ignored in the import process. User must use a comma
	  as delimiter between symbols.

20050306: Changed all futures quote plugins to group symbols into their respective exchanges.
	  For example:

	  ~/Qtstalker/data/Futures/CME/*
	  ~/Qtstalker/data/Futures/NYBOT/*
	  etc...

20050306: Added FW20* futures from Warsaw exchange to the futures database.

20050306: Yahoo Fundamental option now updates the Name field for stocks. NOTE: Composites
          and derivatives don't have fundamental data at yahoo so cannot be updated. Just real stocks.

20050307: Added a new lib to the MySQL plugin for 64bit systems that need the MySQL 64bit lib.

20050307: Changed quotes dialog shortcut key to CTRL+Q because ALT+2 is picked up by some WM's.

20050308: The RSI and STOCH zone lines are missing. Put them back.

20050308: Moved various common network functions from Quote plugins into QuotePlugin base class.
          This is for future CSV network functions being planned.

20050309: Made some GUI changes to the CSV plugin. Removed the rule page from the dialog and
          created a dialog to edit rules. Rules are simpler to edit now.

20050309: Moved the CSV rule storage out of qtstalkerrc and created a directory tree in
          ~/Qtstalker/plugin/quote/CSV/* All the rules will be stored here now. Much better
	  flexibility for storage options. The conversion should be seamless for users, it will
	  be handled automatically the first time the user loads the CSV plugin dialog.

20050310: Fixed bug in Scaler that locked up if the range was zero.

20050310: Added finer scaling to very small bar ranges. Now to 4 decimal places.

20050310: Fixed DatePlot to show euro time format for intraday bars instead of am/pm.

20050310: Some strings that are used internally by various plugins were wrongfully marked
          for translation. Code review to correct these errors. Translation files will need
	  to be corrected to remove those strings. Not many were found, about 50 or so.

20050310: Added new /i18n source tree directory. This will contain all the translation files
          needed for i18n support. Added our first translation file (Polish) thanks to the
	  great effort of Benedict.

20050311: Removed the COT quote plugin. There is no method to chart the data right now. Maybe
          I will return it once there is a way to chart the data without having to create
	  a chart plugin for it.

20050320: Added the qtstalker_pl.qm file to i18n dir. Added a *.qm install procedure to the
          docs .pro file. It will create a /usr/share/qtstalker/i18n dir and copy all the
	  *.qm files there. Translations are now activated on a 'make install'. Cmon folks
	  lets see those translation files now!

20050321: Added 1 and 10 minute bar chart options.

20050322: Added new chart object called Cycle. This draws a series of arcs at the bottom of a
          chart at a regular interval from a starting point. This allows the user to
	  spot regular intervals between peaks and troughs by varying the interval time.

20050323: Added value parms to all chart objects so users can fine tune placement.

20050324: Added a progress bar to the status bar of the main window.

20050324: Removed the data log message page from the quotes dialog. This was creating a lot
          of unused signal overhead.

20050325: Added an extend option to the Fiboline. This extends the lines to the end of the chart.

20050325: Changed the Cycle arcs to vary in height according to their interval. Multiple Cycles
          were difficult to distinguish.

20050325: Fixed bug in Tester and Scanner that created a blank chart if symbol to test was not found.
          This was caused by the data directory structure change.

20050325: The navigator will now purge any invalid group items before displaying them. They don't
          appear because they are broken symlinks, but it is better to get rid of them regardless.

20050326: Changed behaviour of Cycle selection mode. Selecting the first grab box allows user
          to drag the cycle across the chart. Selecting any other grab box will allow user to
	  change the cycle interval.

20050330: Added ACCUM function to the MATH plugin. This performs an accumulation total of the input
          data.

20050330: Added new input values to the BarData class. In addition to open, high, low close etc.
          we can now use date and time values as input. Day the day number of the month. Week is
	  the week number of the year. Month is the month number. DayOfWeek is the day of the week
	  number 1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday.

20050330: Expanded the functionality of the COMP plugin to a full if/then/else type logic behaviour.
          Users are now able to compare 2 sets of data arrays with AND and OR options as well.
	  THEN and ELSE will allow you to use the values of other steps and constants if desired.
	  You will now be able to do something like this:

          if (step1 > 0 && step2 < 100)
            step3
          else
            0

20050404: Merged LOWPASS plugin into MA plugin. Removed LOWPASS plugin.

20050407: Moved PlotLine drawing functions back into Plot. Probably better to keep all the
          Plot related functions confined to Plot.

20050407: Fixed bug in PortfolioDialog that dropped symbol name when trying to edit an item.

20050407: Double click on portfolio item now opens the Portfolio Item edit dialog.

20050407: Added a balance display to the PortfolioDialog.

20050419: Fixed a compile error for FreeBSD in TestPage. Changed static variable
         'copy' to 'copypic'. Clash with some linked library function named 'copy'.

20050421: Fixed indicator tab area to line up properly with the main chart by
          removing the raised border that surrounds the chart.

20050421: Moved the indicator tab area to the bottom of the page as the default.
          This is the better position so the charts are closer together rather
	  than separated by the tabs.

20050512: Added parms to all pro files to compile on FreeBSD 5.*.

20050512: Fixed bug in Plot that segfaults randomly on first chart loaded. Thanks to Jim
          for tracking the bug to ScalePlot trying to draw using an empty Scaler with no
	  parms.

20050512: Fixed bug that would segfault when trying to create the first tabbed indicator. Was
          trying to draw a null pixmap.

20050515: Changed NYBOT plugin to download data instead of first manually saving the data file.
          Yay!!
