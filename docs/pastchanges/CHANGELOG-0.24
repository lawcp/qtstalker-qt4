20040208: Fixed MDK/Redhat compile bug for db.h file not found problem. This was preventing a full
          compile on the big distributions.

20040208: Modified Plot::drawScale to compress the y-axis scaling numbers above 1000.

20040208: Found a new bug in the AD and OBV indicator plugins that can't handle really large numbers.
          Fixed this by applying a divisor of 1000 to all volume values used in the calculations.

20040210: Changed Candle charts to display hollow and filled properly.

20040211: Fixed bug for weekly and monthly charts when volume values exceed the double type limit.
          This fix just disables the values. The proper fix will have to come in the next version
          using Qt3.3 due to qt limits on long double conversion.

20040213: Fixed bug that created phantom indicator when edited.

20040214: Found and fixed the real cause of the volume overflow bug. Turns out it was because Scaler
          just didn't go up high enough. Added more billions to the scaling strings. Restored weekly
	  and monthly volume back to charts. Also restored the OBV and AD indictors by removing the
	  divisor to volume values.

20040214: Fixed bug that didn't refresh the group page if the group is renamed.

20040215: Added new chart type Candle and Candle 2. Candle is the traditional way of plotting candle
          charts. Candle 2 is the qtstalker custom way of candles.

20040217: Fixed trendline bug that behaves erratically if the end point selected is <= the start point.
