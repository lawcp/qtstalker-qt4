          of any symbol (ticker) onto any indicator.

20041021: Removed the OVRLY indicator. Now redundant due to the SYMBOL plugin and
          CUS language functions.

	  on the original high and low levels.

20050106: Changed bar spacing +/- behaviour to keep chart centered instead of defaulting to the
          right edge of the chart.

20050110: Added a timeout parm to the yahoo plugin. This sets how many seconds are allowed
          to elapse during each symbol being downloaded. If a symbol takes more than the set
	  time to complete, the download will abort and move on to the next symbol.

20050112: Fixed bug in crosshair draws that didn't draw on the left edge of plot.

20050113: Fixed yahoo plugin to download symbols in sorted order.

20050114: Changed plot cursor to reflect drawmode status. If drawmode is on then cursor is an
          arrow. If drawmode is off then cursor is a cross.

          plugin can restore it properly without having to manually move the imported chart.

20050116: Fixed bug that segfaults when context menu is called with no chart loaded at startup.

20050117: Added a percentage changed field next to the change field in the plot info string
          as per user request.

          before start point.

20050122: As per user request, the yahoo plugin now preloads all stock symbols as a default so
          that the user need not bring up the dialog to select symbols. Once the yahoo plugin is selected
	  from the quotes dialog the user can just start the update.

20050122: Moved the 'CH=' info on the main chart info line to the left. This is so at least
          the unique data here is still visible on a small chart.

20050122: MySQLPlugin now checks for any deleted symbols before downloading and updates it's
          symbol list.
