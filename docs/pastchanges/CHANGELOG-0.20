- Some compile errors reported because I made some changes that apply to Qt3.1.2 that are not compatible with Qt3.0*
  Back ported the QString::remove to Qt3.0*

- I split the ./compile script into 2 scripts. ./compile creates the qtstalker binary, and ./compile_plugins creates all
  the plugins. This is to make the compile process more efficient and flexible.

- Thanks to Marco van Zwetselaar for a patch to implement Log scaling to charts.

- Added a "Color Bars" parm to draw color up and down bars for the VOL plugin. This only works if you use the
  histogram bars line style.

- Added a data panel located under the tab area that dynamically updates all the chart values where the mouse is currently located.

- Reports that 0.19 does not create a binary on some dist's "Debian". 0.17 compiles fine. I think this is because
  I removed the -ldl linker option for FreeBSD. Some dist's need the linker option. Updated all the *.pro files to add
  the -ldl linker option if on a linux-g++ system.

- Added new chart type "Swing". This is the typical Gann swing chart type.

- Experimented with an OSX port. Turns out apple has a broken plugin system, you can load them but can't unload them.
  Until they fix this, a OSX port will not be practical or efficient. Cmon apple, even win32 can do this...think different?

- Added the stdlib header to GroupPage to fix a compile error on Debian.

- Fixed a bug that didn't update the ChartPage after downloading quotes for the first time.

- Backported QTable::setColumnLabel() function to Qt3.0.* It seems most of the compile errors being reported are caused
  by very small changes in the 3.1* versions. Most distributions are still using the 3.0* version, guess I'm spoiled
  using Gentoo.

- fixed QDir::refresh() compile error, backported to Qt 3.0*
