To Do:
======

- create some howto docs for quote plugins
- postgresql quote plugin
- key bindings
- key binding scripting
- trendlines and fibo objects to plot on weekly and monthly charts as well
  https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4527886
- allow negative displacement for line plots
- default CSV plugin import rules to the install process
- change Quote behaviour in yahoo plugin to create separate symbols for intraday and daily
  data. also put a timer on yahoo plugin for intraday tick downloads every X minutes. same limitations
  will apply as in the CSV timer
- overhaul CSV plugin to allow URL downloads and clean up code...it's a mess  
- add more crosshairs behaviours to IndicatorPlot
- user defined bar lengths for intraday charts
- add better icons for add/insert in the edit formula dialog widget, functions not obvious
- create CUS tutorial.
- add stock margins to the tester
- add ability to not draw sections of plotlines. (vectors)
- save last chart viewed between sessions.
- add paper trade mode to portfolio tracker (use last chart value instead of last db value)
- add optimization range testing for the backtester.
- fix: negative account volume trades in the tester.
- add: there is no way to use buy/sell prices in stop formulas in the tester. 
- median lines chart objects
- fibo time chart objects
- add more stats to edit chart dialog ie. high date low date 
- add default scanners for biggest % gainers, new 52 week highs etc.
- add more flexible symbol and directory selector for the yahoo plugin.
- add ExScript CUS interface for indicators and plots.
- remove full paths from all files, only symbol is needed for index lookup
- change yahoo plugin to get fundamentals on new charts automatically 
- display chart object info when cursor hovers over them in the data panel or make tooltip.
- update classes with a description of purpose, usage etc.
- the compressionCombo does not keep the compression buttons toggled.
- lib/TALIB.cpp should use TA-Abstract for parameter validation.
  See Mario's comments: https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4585375
- Improve the use of window margins and borders. On some systems there is wasted
  screen space. See some notes in src/Qtstalker.cpp setContentsMargins()
- Create default docs/indicator/*.html for all the existing misc/CUS_examples, e.g. "CV - Chaikin Volatility".
- Round off values to lesser precision when displaying in data panel.
- Some old files have not been removed from CVS (CC.cpp Index.cpp Spread*.cpp). See discussion in mail archives about this functionality which has moved but seems to have trouble. The lingering files caused compile troubles for someone, but not for others.
- There are many empty CVS directories. Remove them.
- Improve source code documentation. Javadoc comments are utilised by Doxygen.
Need more comments, starting with top-level classes.

- Experiment with SVN trunk version of TA-Lib. Provide feedback to them if we have issues. Their 0.5 release is scheduled for January 2008.
 
Move to Qt4:
============
* See Issue: #1943707 - porting from Qt3 to Qt4
* Review the code and prepare for move by not using certain Qt3 features:
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/porting4-overview.html
* Run the qt3to4 porting tool and use Qt3Support library:
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/porting4.html
* Refine code to remove Qt3 dependencies.

Maybe some day:
===============

- I would love to add scripting. This is by far the hardest thing to implement.
  So, fat chance I'm going to get this done soon without any help... help.... 
  help...

- A proper portfolio manager.

- support for options
